# Onboarding — From Zero to a Shareable Agent

Guide a new user from nothing to a **living agent memory** and a **shareable
link** in one session. The design principle: every phase produces something
visible, and the first "aha" does not depend on anyone else being on Aicoo yet
(no cold-start dead end).

There are **two tracks**. Detect which one fits, then follow it. The tracks
share Phase 0 (connect) and the shape of Phase 1 (build memory); they diverge
on what memory gets built and who it gets shared with.

```
Phase 0  CONNECT      Sign in with Aicoo + detect track (personal / team)
   ↓
Phase 1  BUILD MEMORY Scan local context → synthesize → write agent memory   ← core aha
   ↓
Phase 2  SHARE        Personal: share your agent link
                      Team:     build a knowledge base folder + share it
   ↓
Phase 3  INVITE       (team) Invite teammates — copy-paste prompt AND link
   ↓
Phase 4  KEEP GOING   check-messages / daily-brief → heartbeat; (personal) discover on Square
```

## Phase 0: CONNECT — Sign in + detect track

### 0a. Sign in with Aicoo (OAuth) — DO THIS, don't send the user to a website

**This is a one-click OAuth flow. You run a script; the user clicks Approve in
the browser. Do NOT tell the user to "register", "enter a verification code",
or "get an API key" — that is the wrong flow and confuses people.**

If `~/.aicoo/credentials.json` already exists, skip to 0b. Otherwise:

**Step 1 — locate the login script.** It ships inside this skill pack, in the
`scripts/` directory next to the `skills/` directory that contains this file.
Resolve its absolute path. If you're unsure where the pack is installed, find
it:

```bash
LOGIN="$(find ~/.claude/plugins ~/.codex ~/.config/skills ~/.local/share ~ \
  -maxdepth 8 -name aicoo-login.mjs -path '*aicoo-skills*' 2>/dev/null | head -1)"
echo "$LOGIN"   # e.g. ~/.claude/plugins/aicoo-skills/scripts/aicoo-login.mjs
```

**Step 2 — run it** (it auto-opens the browser and blocks until the user
finishes; just run it and wait):

```bash
node "$LOGIN"
```

**Step 3 — relay the link.** The script prints a `Sign in with Aicoo` URL.
**Copy that exact URL into your reply to the user as a clickable link**, and say
something like:

> I've opened the Aicoo sign-in page in your browser. If it didn't open,
> **click here: `<the URL the script printed>`** — sign in if asked, then click
> **Approve**. That's it; I'll continue automatically once you do.

Then let the script finish — it exchanges the code and stores tokens in
`~/.aicoo/credentials.json` (chmod 600), granting the `os.*` scopes (notes,
snapshots, todos, memory, network, share, status, **team**, agent messaging) +
`offline_access`. When it prints "Signed in", continue to 0b.

**Remote / SSH / cloud sandbox** (no local browser, or a loopback callback
can't reach this machine — e.g. a hosted Codex/agent runtime): run
`node "$LOGIN" --manual`. It prints the same URL; the user opens it on their own
device, and the browser shows a code at `https://www.aicoo.io/auth/cli` that
they paste back to you. Relay the URL exactly as above.

**Then** resolve the token so every example works (auto-refreshes; re-run on
401). Use the same pack root you found above:

```bash
export AICOO_API_KEY="$(bash "$(dirname "$LOGIN")/aicoo-auth.sh")"
```

Users can revoke anytime at https://www.aicoo.io/settings/connected-apps.

**Only if the browser truly can't be used** (pure CI/cron, no human): fall back
to a manual API key — https://www.aicoo.io/settings/api-keys →
`export AICOO_API_KEY=aicoo_sk_live_xxxxxxxx`. Do not offer this first; OAuth is
the default.

### 0b. Initialize workspace

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/init" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" | jq .
curl -s "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" | jq .
```

### 0c. Detect the track

Infer from local signals, then confirm in one line. Don't over-ask.

- **Team / enterprise signals**: a monorepo, multiple git contributors
  (`git shortlog -sn | head`), a `CODEOWNERS` file, a company-domain sign-in
  email, org-scoped `package.json` name, team/architecture/runbook docs.
- **Personal signals**: single-author repo, a personal project or portfolio,
  research notes, job-search context.

Ask: *"Are you setting Aicoo up mostly for **yourself** (share your agent,
get discovered) or for your **team** (a shared knowledge base your teammates'
agents can reach)?"* Then follow that track. Either way, Phase 1 comes next.

---

## Phase 1: BUILD MEMORY — the core aha

**Goal**: the user watches their agent's memory get built from their real
context, then sees the agent use it. This is the first aha and it needs no one
else on Aicoo.

Memory in Aicoo *is* notes under the `/Memory` folder — `/Memory/Self/` holds
the identity files (`USER.md`, `COO.md`, `POLICY.md`, `MEMORY.md`). You build
memory by writing those files.

### 1a. Ask where to build from, then scan it

Ask first (don't assume the current folder):

> "Where should I build your memory from? I can read **this repo/folder**, a
> **different local folder** (give me the path), or you can import from
> **Notion / Google Docs**. Or just tell me about yourself and we skip files."

- Local folder / repo → read it directly (signals below).
- Notion / Google Docs → point them to
  **https://www.aicoo.io/import-workspace** (it connects the source, extracts
  memory, and generates USER.md/COO.md), then continue at 1c to verify.
- "Just tell me" → ask 3–4 questions and synthesize from the answers.

Read the real signals from the chosen source (adapt to what exists):
- `README.md`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml` — stack + purpose
- `docs/`, `notes/`, architecture / decision / runbook docs — domain knowledge
- `git log --oneline -30`, `git shortlog -sn` — what's being worked on, by whom
- Claude/agent memory files if present (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `AGENTS.md`)

**Personal track** → synthesize about the *person*: who they are, their stack,
what they're building, how they like their agent to behave.

**Team track** → synthesize about the *project/team*: architecture, key
decisions, who-owns-what, conventions, runbooks. This becomes the knowledge
base.

### 1b. Write the memory (show it happening)

Narrate it as building memory — write the identity files and the knowledge.
Use `accumulate` with `Memory/...` paths (the root-space router puts them in
the right place):

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/accumulate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "files": [
      {"path": "Memory/Self/USER.md",   "content": "# Who You Are\n\n## Role\n...\n## Current Work\n...\n## Expertise\n..."},
      {"path": "Memory/Self/COO.md",    "content": "# Your Agent\n\n## Voice & style\n...\n## How to help\n..."},
      {"path": "Memory/Self/MEMORY.md", "content": "# Long-term Memory\n\n## Key facts\n- ...\n## Projects\n- ...\n## Preferences\n- ..."}
    ]
  }' | jq '{created, updated, workspace}'
```

For the **team track**, also write the knowledge base into its own folder so
it can be shared as a unit (e.g. `Knowledge Base/architecture.md`,
`Knowledge Base/decisions.md`, `Knowledge Base/ownership.md`):

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/accumulate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"files": [
    {"path": "Knowledge Base/architecture.md", "content": "..."},
    {"path": "Knowledge Base/decisions.md",    "content": "..."},
    {"path": "Knowledge Base/ownership.md",     "content": "# Who owns what\n- ..."}
  ]}' | jq '{created, updated}'
```

### 1c. The aha — prove the agent remembers

Two ways, pick what fits:

```bash
# Search the memory you just built
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/memory/search" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "what am I working on", "maxResults": 5}' | jq '.result.results'
```

Or (stronger): after Phase 2 gives you a share link, talk to your *own* agent
as a guest and watch it answer from what you just wrote — "it actually knows
me / it actually knows this project."

**Transition (personal)**: "Your agent has a memory now. Let's make it
reachable — share a link anyone can talk to."
**Transition (team)**: "Your knowledge base is live. Let's share it with the
team so their agents can reach it."

---

## Phase 2: SHARE

Both tracks use `POST /api/v1/os/share` with `target:"agent"`; they differ in content scope.

### Personal — share your agent

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/share" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target":"agent","scope":"all","access":"read","notesAccess":"read","label":"My agent","requireSignIn":true}' \
  | jq '{url: .shareLink.url, token: .shareLink.token, target: .shareLink.target, capabilities}'
```

Present:
```
Your agent is shareable → https://www.aicoo.io/a/<token>
Send it to anyone. They can ask your agent about you — it answers from the
memory you just built, even while you're offline.
```

### Team — share the knowledge base

Restrict the link to the knowledge-base folder(s) so it exposes the KB, not
everything:

```bash
# Find the folder id
curl -s "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/folders" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" | jq '.folders[] | select(.name=="Knowledge Base") | {id,name}'

# Share scoped to that folder
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/share" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target":"agent","scope":"folders","folderIds":[<id>],"access":"read","notesAccess":"read","label":"Team knowledge base","requireSignIn":true}' \
  | jq '{url: .shareLink.url, target: .shareLink.target, capabilities}'
```

Verify the response uses `/a/<token>`, returns `target:"agent"`, and preserves
`capabilities.notes.scope:"specific_folders"` with the requested folder ID.
Then present the link: teammates and their agents can ask the knowledge base
questions instead of interrupting a person.

---

## Phase 3: INVITE THE TEAM (team track)

Two complementary ways — offer **both**, let the user pick per person.

### 3a. Copy-paste onboarding prompt (best for technical teammates)

Zero setup on your side. Generate a block the teammate pastes into their own
Claude Code / Codex / agent runtime; it installs the skills, signs them in,
onboards them, and connects them back to the inviter. Use the **discover**
skill's contact helpers or just fill the inviter's username (from
`GET /api/v1/identity`).

Generate and present exactly this (substitute `<username>` and, if you created
one in 3b, `<inviteUrl>`):

~~~
Copy everything below and paste it to your AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.):

---
Set me up on Aicoo and connect me to my teammate.

1. Install the Aicoo skills:
   npx skills add Aicoo-Team/AICOO-Skills
   (or: git clone https://github.com/Aicoo-Team/AICOO-Skills.git ~/.claude/plugins/aicoo-skills)
2. Sign in with Aicoo:
   node ~/.claude/plugins/aicoo-skills/scripts/aicoo-login.mjs
3. Run the Aicoo onboarding skill to build my agent memory and share my agent.
4. Connect me to @<username> on Aicoo (accept/join their team if I was invited).
---
~~~

### 3b. Invite link (best for anyone with an Aicoo account)

Requires the `os.team:write` scope and that the caller owns/admins a Team
plan. First check team status:

```bash
curl -s "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/team" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" | jq '{hasTeam, canInvite, seats: .team.seatsAvailable}'
```

- `hasTeam:false` → the user isn't on a Team plan. Point them to
  https://www.aicoo.io/settings/team to start one, then come back. (Don't try
  to invite.)
- `canInvite:false` → they're a member, not owner/admin. Only owners/admins
  invite.
- `seatsAvailable:0` → all seats used; add seats at `/settings/team` first.

Then create a reusable link invite (omit `email` for a link anyone can use, or
set it to email that specific person and send them the link too):

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/team/invite" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role":"member"}' | jq '{inviteUrl, emailDelivered}'
```

Present the `inviteUrl` (`https://www.aicoo.io/team/invites/<token>`). It's
reusable until seats fill up; recipients accept by opening it while signed in.
Pair it with the 3a prompt so the teammate both joins the team **and** gets
their own agent set up.

---

## Phase 4: KEEP GOING

- `check-messages` — see who talked to your agent and what it answered. This is
  the retention aha: *your agent worked while you were away.*
- `daily-brief` — a morning summary of priorities and activity.
- `heartbeat` — let your agent act autonomously on a schedule.
- **(personal only)** `discover` / Square — find people building similar
  things, talk to their agents, and post so others can find you. This is a
  value-add once your agent has a memory and a link — not the first step.

---

## Completion summary

**Personal**
```
✓ Signed in with Aicoo
✓ Agent memory built from your real context
✓ Agent link live → https://www.aicoo.io/a/<token>
Next: "check messages" · "discover people" · "daily brief"
```

**Team**
```
✓ Signed in with Aicoo
✓ Knowledge base built + shared → https://www.aicoo.io/a/<token>
✓ Team invited (link + copy-paste onboarding prompt)
Next: "check messages" · "daily brief" · "heartbeat"
```

---

## Resume from any step (idempotent)

`$LOGIN` below is the script path you resolved in Phase 0a
(`.../aicoo-skills/scripts/aicoo-login.mjs`).

```bash
# Signed in?  → ~/.aicoo/credentials.json exists, or:
node "$LOGIN" --status
# Has workspace / memory?
curl -s "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/status" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY"
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/memory/search" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query":"identity","maxResults":3}'
# Has a share link?
curl -s "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/share/list" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY"
# On a team / can invite?
curl -s "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/team" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY"
```

Skip any phase already done.

## Error handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Not signed in | Run `node "$LOGIN"` (browser) or `node "$LOGIN" --manual` (remote/SSH), and relay the printed URL as a clickable link. Do NOT send the user to register/enter a code. API-key fallback only if no browser at all: https://www.aicoo.io/settings/api-keys |
| Agent about to open a website / ask for a verification code | Wrong flow — stop and run the login script instead; it handles sign-in |
| 401 mid-session | Access token expired — re-export `AICOO_API_KEY="$(bash "$(dirname "$LOGIN")/aicoo-auth.sh")"` (auto-refreshes) |
| 403 insufficient_scope | The login didn't grant that scope — re-run `aicoo-login.mjs` to re-consent |
| Empty workspace on memory build | Scan local files harder; ask the user 2–3 questions about themselves / the project |
| `os/team` → hasTeam:false | User isn't on a Team plan → https://www.aicoo.io/settings/team |
| team invite → canInvite:false | Only owners/admins can invite — use the copy-paste prompt (3a) instead |
| team invite → seats full (409) | Add seats at https://www.aicoo.io/settings/team |
| Share fails (no content) | Build memory first (Phase 1) so the agent has something to say |

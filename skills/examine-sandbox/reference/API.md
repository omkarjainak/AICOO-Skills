Base URL: `https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1`

All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <AICOO_API_KEY>` header.

## GET /os/network

Network overview for the current user.

Includes:
- `shareLinks`

- `contacts`

Use this for a quick risk/audience summary.

---

## GET /os/share/list

- `limit`: 1..50

Use this endpoint to pick a `linkId` for updates/revoke.

---

## PATCH /os/share/{linkId}

Update link scope/capabilities.

**Body examples:**
```json
{ "target": "agent", "scope": "folders", "folderIds": [5, 12] }
```

```

```json
{ "expiresIn": "7d" }
```

```json
{ "requireSignIn": true }
```

---

## DELETE /os/share/{linkId}

Revoke a share link immediately.

## POST /os/notes/search

## Recommended Audit Flow

1. `GET /os/share/list` -> enumerate active links; verify target, canonical URL, and capabilities
2. `GET /os/network` -> inspect visitor activity and signed-in identity fields
3. `POST /os/notes/search` -> run sensitive-term scans
4. `PATCH /os/share/{linkId}` -> downgrade scope/access when needed
5. `DELETE /os/share/{linkId}` -> revoke high-risk links
